# Pyber Analysis

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to summarize data collected by PyBer, a ridesharing company, and look for disparities in the level of service among three types of cities : Rural, Suburban, and Urban.

## Results

An analysis of data collected by Pyber in rural, suburban, and urban cities clearly shows there are disparities in the level of service amongst city types. For instance, rural America is home to 13% of the US population, and even though 97% of the land mass in the US is considered rural (https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/08/rural-america.html), only 3% of drivers (78 out of 2973) serve rural areas. The average number of rides per rural driver (1.6) exceeds that of suburban drivers (1.3) and urban drivers (0.68). This potentially drives up the cost for PyBer's services for clients in rural areas, where the average fare per ride exceeds that of both suburban and urban areas (it would be interesting to know the average cost per mile, as mileage also impacts the fare). Despite higher fares, only 7% of fares collected by PyBer is generated by rural areas. This general trend is consistent year round, as shown by the figure below.

## Summary of Business Reccomendations

This data clearly shows PyBer needs to focus on increasing the level of service to rural areas. This may be acccomplished by focusing on increasing the number of drivers found in these areas, looking for ways to decrease the average fare per ride so more people use the service, and increasing advertising campaigns to rural areas to encourage people to use PyBer.
